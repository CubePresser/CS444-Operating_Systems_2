If you are using bash, use the command "build" to use the build script to compile main.c and then run the command "main" to run the program.

Compile instructions without the script:

gcc -lpthread main.c -o main

Run the command main.

----------------------------------------
This program will never end so make sure to use CTRL-C to terminate the program.
